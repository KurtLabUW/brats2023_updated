# Kurtlab's submission to BraTS 2023

This repository contains the code developed by Kurtlab for the 2023 International Brain Tumor Segmentations (BraTS) Cluster of Challenges (see [here](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn51156910/wiki/621282).)
The aim of the BraTS Challenges is to push the state-of-the-art in brain tumor segmentation algorithms. That is, algorithms that can segment tumor subregions from multiparametric MRI scans of the brain.

We submitted to three challenges:
1. Adult gliomas.
2. BraTS-Africa - gliomas from patients in sub-Saharan Africa.
3. Meningiomas.

Our team ranked in the top 10 of all those who submitted, including 7th place in the BraTS-Africa challenge.
